It is so that the input will be a set of data that will be converted into a matrix. Then, the matrix will be solved by Gauss-Seidel method to produce a single function. Lastly, the function will be differentiated as another function and will be processed by the Root-Finding methods to produce the value of x when f(x) is either minimum or maximum.\n",
