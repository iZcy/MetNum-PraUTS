Welcome to my workspace!
This file consists of Modulated files and compact file where all of the codes are put into one file only.
You can access the Modulated file and launch the main.py for launching the program. This way also allows you to put massive data input by editing the inputFiles folder contents.
For simpler access, you can also check the compactMain.py where every code is put into one platform.

All depends to your preference.
Thanks!
